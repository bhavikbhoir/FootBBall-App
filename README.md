# The FootBBall App
A Football App built in react for checking the standings of major European Football leagues. At the moment you can check standings for Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Bundesliga and Eredivisie. 
You can also check updates from the UEFA Champions LEague.

I've used fetch API, football-data.org Api and React for creating this app.

The App is bootstrapped using react-bootstrap.
